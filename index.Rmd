Prerequisites:

* installed [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* installed [RStudio Desktop](http://www.rstudio.com/download) (it is not necessary, but RStudio makes a lot of things easier)
* if you don't want to install anything, try [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/), it is slow at first time, but then you'll have the full RStudio on-line.
